# G-AthArt-MicrobitGestureTrainer
A program that analyzes different gestures with Microbit, and displays in wekinator how closely you reproduced the gesture (green output bars).

## What your goal is
We were thinking about how you could use Microbit, and tape it to the end of a bat or tennis racket to collect accelerometer data. Using wekinator's dynamic time warping, you can measure how close the user got to the correct form with the stroke of a bat or tennis racket.
This would greatly help to improve people's form using a digital training system.
Becase I don't have the right sports equipment on hand, and I don't have a large enough work area to practice baseball swings, I used a Harry Potter themed approach to increase the entertainment factor, and the ease of training.
The wand motions in Harry Potter require small, precise actions, which was feasible with a USB cable connected to my microbit. I rolled up two pieces of paper to create a fake "wand" and taped the mirobit inside it, at the tip. I routed the USB cable through, and it came out at the back end of the tube with room to spare to plug into the laptop.
